# Raw-UI

A barebonas SDL2-imgui bridge/wrapper.

I couldn't get autowrap/claw to work reasonably, even with cimgui (and the only prepackaged autowrap-generated bindings seem to lack many important definitions, notably for structs), so here we are.

## Features

- SWIG 3-based bindings for Dear Imgui (not based on cimgui), hand-fixed
- SDL2 packaged libraries (but fix the loader and compile your own for other platforms)
- Bindings for the ImGui_Impl{SDL|OpenGL3} "examples" from imgui
- Small helpers to get it all up and running quick
